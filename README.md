## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning system capable of classifying specific human activities from a real-time video stream. The system will analyze movements such as walking, turning, sitting, and standing by tracking key body joints. This work aims to apply the theoretical concepts of supervised learning to a practical computer vision problem, following a structured methodology from data collection to model evaluation.

## Project Description
This project addresses a supervised classification problem focused on identifying human actions from video data. Our main hypothesis is that we can accurately classify activities by using the spatial coordinates of body joints as features for machine learning models.

The project will follow the CRISP-DM methodology, beginning with data collection (recording videos of team members performing the specified actions) and proceeding through data preparation. During the preparation phase, we will use MediaPipe to extract skeletal landmarks and Pandas for data cleaning and transformation. Subsequently, we will train and compare various classification models available in Scikit-learn, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, to determine the most effective approach.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project environment.

1.  **Clone this repo**. For help, see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
2.  **Install the required dependencies**. Ensure you have Python installed, then run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe scikit-learn pandas jupyter
    ```
3.  **Raw data** (videos) used for training and testing will be kept in the `/data/raw` folder.
4.  **Data processing scripts and notebooks** are located in the `/notebooks` and `/src` directories.
